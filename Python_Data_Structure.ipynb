        "\n",
        "Ans: String slicing is a method in Python to extract a part of a string by specifying a range of indices. The syntax for slicing is string[start:end:step].\n",
        "\n",
        "* start: The position where the slice begins (inclusive).\n",
        "* end: The position where the slice ends (exclusive).\n",
        "* step: (Optional) The interval between elements.\n",
        "\n",
        " Example: If we have the string \"Hello, World!\":\n",
        "\n",
        "* string[0:5] will return \"Hello\" (characters from index 0 to 4).\n",
        "* string[7:] will return \"World!\" (characters from index 7 to the end).\n",
        "\n",
        "Slicing is useful when you need to extract parts of strings for operations like substring searches or formatting.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2.Explain the key features of lists in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: A list in Python is an ordered, mutable collection of elements. Key features include:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Ordered: Items in a list are stored in a specific sequence, and you can access them using their index.\n",
        "* Mutable: You can modify the list by adding, changing, or removing elements.\n",
        "* Allows duplicates: Lists can contain the same item multiple times.\n",
        "* Supports different data types: A list can hold elements of different types, such as integers, strings, and other lists.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: A list can look like this: my_list = [1, \"apple\", 3.14, True]. You can access the first element with my_list[0] which returns 1.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "3.Describe how to access, modify, and delete elements in a list with examples\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:\n",
        "* Access Elements: Use the index to retrieve elements from a list. Lists are zero-indexed.\n",
        " * Example: my_list = [10, 20, 30], my_list[1] returns 20.\n",
        "* Modify Elements: Assign a new value to a specific index.\n",
        " * Example: my_list[1] = 25 changes the second element to 25.\n",
        "*Delete Elements: You can delete elements using del, pop(), or remove().\n",
        " * Example: del my_list[1] removes the element at index 1. Now my_list = [10, 30].\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "4.Compare and contrast tuples and lists with examples.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:\n",
        "* Tuples:\n",
        "\n",
        " * Definition: Tuples are immutable sequences, meaning their elements cannot be changed after creation.\n",
        " * Example: A tuple like (3, 5) represents fixed coordinates.\n",
        "* Lists:\n",
        "\n",
        " * Definition: Lists are mutable sequences, allowing changes to their elements after creation.\n",
        " * Example: A shopping list like [“apples,” “bananas,” “oranges”] can be modified as needed.\n",
        "* Key Differences:\n",
        "\n",
        " * Syntax: Tuples use parentheses (); lists use square brackets [].\n",
        " * Mutability: Tuples are immutable; lists are mutable.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.Describe the key features of sets and provide examples of their use.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:\n",
        "* Definition: Sets are unordered collections of unique elements that automatically eliminate duplicates.\n",
        "\n",
        " * Example: A set like {1, 2, 3, 4} will store only unique values, ignoring any duplicates.\n",
        "* Unordered: The elements in a set do not have a specific order, meaning they cannot be accessed by index.\n",
        "\n",
        " * Example: In the set {3, 1, 2}, the order may change each time you print it.\n",
        "* Mutable: Sets are mutable, allowing you to add or remove elements after creation.\n",
        "\n",
        " * Example: Starting with {“apple,” “banana”}, you can add “orange” to create {“apple,” “banana,” “orange”}.\n",
        "* No Duplicates: Sets automatically remove duplicate entries, ensuring each element is unique.\n",
        "\n",
        " * Example: If you try to create a set with {1, 2, 2, 3}, it will store it as {1, 2, 3}.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.Discuss the use cases of tuples and sets in Python programming.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:\n",
        "* Tuples: Tuples are often used to store data that should not change, such as coordinates or configuration data. Their immutability ensures that the values stay the same throughout the program.\n",
        " * Example: A tuple (x, y) can represent a 2D coordinate.\n",
        "* Sets: Sets are useful when you need to work with unique elements or perform mathematical set operations like union, intersection, or difference.\n",
        " * Example: Use sets to remove duplicates from a list or find common elements between two collections, like set1 & set2 for the intersection.\n",
        "\n",
        "7.Describe how to add, modify, and delete items in a dictionary with examples.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:A dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs where each key must be unique.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Add Items: You can add a new key-value pair by assigning a value to a new key.\n",
        " * Example: my_dict['name'] = 'Alice' adds the key 'name' with the value 'Alice'.\n",
        "* Modify Items: To modify a value, assign a new value to an existing key.\n",
        " * Example: my_dict['age'] = 30 changes the value associated with the key 'age'.\n",
        "* Delete Items: Use del or pop() to remove a key-value pair.\n",
        " * Example: del my_dict['name'] removes the key 'name' from the dictionary.\n",
        "\n",
        "8.Discuss the importance of dictionary keys being immutable and provide examples.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Dictionary keys must be immutable because Python uses hashing to manage dictionaries internally. Hash values must remain constant, which is why mutable types like lists cannot be used as keys.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Immutable keys: Strings, numbers, and tuples are commonly used as keys because their values do not change.\n",
        " * Example: You can use a string as a key: my_dict = {\"name\": \"Alice\"}.\n",
        "* Mutable keys not allowed: Lists and other mutable types are not allowed because they can change after being used as a key, causing issues with the dictionary's hash-based structure.\n",
